## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **‚ùå Issue 1: Brand-Level Invitation Security Flaw**
**Problem:** Current system allows members to invite users when only admins/managers should have this permission.

**Impact:** Security vulnerability where regular members can invite users to brands.

**Solution Required:** Fix invitation endpoint to check brand-specific permissions instead of global roles.

### **‚ùå Issue 2: Missing Project-Level Invitations**
**Problem:** Users invited to a brand get access to ALL projects in that brand.

**Impact:** No granular project-level access control.

**Solution Required:** Implement project-level invitation system with separate access control.

---

## üîß REQUIRED FIXES (URGENT)

### **Phase 1: Security Fixes (Critical)**
1. **Fix Brand-Level Invitation Security**
   - Update invitation endpoint to check brand-specific permissions
   - Restrict user invitations to admins and managers only
   - Add role change restrictions

2. **Implement Project-Level Invitations**
   - Create ProjectUser model for project-specific access
   - Implement project-level invitation APIs
   - Update project access control

### **Phase 2: Access Control Enhancement**
1. **Two-Level Access Control**
   - Brand Level: User is member of brand (can see brand info)
   - Project Level: User is member of specific projects (can see project details)

2. **Granular Permissions**
   - Project-specific user management
   - Role-based project access
   - Invitation workflow improvements
