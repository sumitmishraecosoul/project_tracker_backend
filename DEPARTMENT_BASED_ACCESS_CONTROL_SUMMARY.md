# Department-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of department-based access control and role-based permissions for the Project Tracker API. The changes ensure that users can only access and modify data within their authorized scope based on their role and department.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Project Model Updates
**File:** `models/Project.js`
- Added `department` field to track which department created the project
- Department field is required and uses the same enum values as User model
- Ensures all projects are associated with a specific department

### 2. Dashboard Controller Enhancements
**File:** `controllers/dashboardController.js`
- **Department-based filtering**: All dashboard data is now filtered based on user role and selected department
- **Admin filtering**: Admins can use `?department=DepartmentName` query parameter to filter data
- **Manager/Employee restrictions**: Automatically restricted to their own department's data
- **Enhanced project data**: Projects now include department information and active member counts
- **Team member filtering**: Team members list is filtered by department
- **Updated response structure**: Added `selectedDepartment` and `teamMembers` fields

### 3. Project Controller Security Updates
**File:** `controllers/projectController.js`
- **New authorization functions**:
  - `canViewProject()`: Enhanced to check department-based access
  - `canEditProject()`: New function to check edit/delete permissions
- **Role-based restrictions**:
  - **Employees**: Cannot create, edit, or delete any projects
  - **Managers**: Can only edit/delete projects from their own department
  - **Admins**: Full access to all projects
- **Enhanced project responses**: Include department info and active member counts
- **Department assignment**: New projects automatically get the creator's department

### 4. Task Controller Security Updates
**File:** `controllers/taskController.js`
- **New authorization function**: `canEditTask()` for edit/delete permissions
- **Role-based restrictions**:
  - **Employees**: Cannot create, edit, or delete any tasks
  - **Managers**: Can only edit/delete tasks from their own department
  - **Admins**: Full access to all tasks
- **Enhanced task filtering**: Department-based access control for task lists

### 5. Route Protection Updates
**Files:** `routes/projects.js`, `routes/tasks.js`
- **Added authorization middleware**: `authorize(['admin', 'manager'])` for create/update/delete operations
- **View operations**: All authenticated users can view based on their role permissions
- **Modification operations**: Restricted to managers and admins only

### 6. Migration Script
**File:** `migration-add-department-to-projects.js`
- **Purpose**: Add department information to existing projects
- **Process**: Updates projects with missing department field based on creator's department
- **Safety**: Includes error handling and verification

## API Response Changes

### Dashboard Summary Response

}
```

### Project List Response
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "_id": "project_id",
      "title": "Project Title",
      "department": "India E-commerce",
      "activeMembersCount": 3,
      "createdBy": {
        "name": "Creator Name",
        "email": "creator@example.com",

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Role-Based Access Matrix

| Operation | Admin | Manager | Employee |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| View all projects | ✅ | ❌ (own dept only) | ❌ (involved only) |
| Create projects | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit projects | ✅ | ✅ (own dept only) | ❌ |
| Delete projects | ✅ | ✅ (own dept only) | ❌ |
| View all tasks | ✅ | ❌ (own dept only) | ❌ (involved only) |
| Create tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit tasks | ✅ | ✅ (own dept only) | ❌ |
| Delete tasks | ✅ | ✅ (own dept only) | ❌ |
| Department filtering | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Frontend Integration Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Updates
- **Department Selector**: Add department dropdown for admin users
- **Filter Integration**: Send `?department=DepartmentName` query parameter
- **UI Updates**: Display department information and active member counts for projects
- **Team Members**: Show filtered team members based on selected department

### 2. Project Management
- **Permission Checks**: Hide create/edit/delete buttons for employees
- **Department Display**: Show department information in project cards and details
- **Active Members**: Display active member count for each project
- **Access Control**: Disable actions based on user role and department

### 3. Task Management
- **Permission Checks**: Hide create/edit/delete buttons for employees
- **Department Filtering**: Ensure tasks are filtered by department
- **Access Control**: Disable actions based on user role and department

### 4. User Experience
- **Clear Messaging**: Show appropriate messages when users don't have permission
- **Department Indicators**: Clearly show which department data is being displayed
- **Role-based UI**: Adapt interface based on user role

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run Migration Script
```bash
node migration-add-department-to-projects.js
```

### 2. Verify Data
- Check that all existing projects have department information
- Verify that dashboard filtering works correctly
- Test role-based access control

### 3. Update Frontend
- Implement department selector for admins
- Add department information display
- Update permission checks
- Test all user roles and scenarios

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Users can only access data from their department
2. **Role-based Permissions**: Clear separation of responsibilities
3. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged with user context
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add new departments or modify permissions
5. **Compliance**: Meets organizational security requirements

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin can view all departments and filter data
- [ ] Manager can only access their department's data
- [ ] Employee cannot create/edit/delete projects or tasks
- [ ] Department information is displayed correctly
- [ ] Active member counts are accurate
- [ ] Permission errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Migration script runs successfully
- [ ] All existing functionality still works

## Notes

- The migration script should be run before deploying to production
- All new projects will automatically get the creator's department
- Existing projects without department info will be updated by the migration
- The system maintains backward compatibility while adding new security features
