# Multi-Brand Project Tracker Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of a multi-brand project management system similar to Asana, with brand-level isolation and role-based access control.

## Database Schema vs API Endpoints - Recommendation

### **Start with Database Schema Changes (RECOMMENDED)**

**Why Database First is Better:**
1. **Foundation First**: Database schema is the foundation - everything else depends on it
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures proper relationships and constraints from the start
3. **API Consistency**: APIs will be more consistent when built on solid schema
4. **Testing**: Easier to test with proper data structure
5. **Migration Safety**: Better to handle data migration early in the process

**Implementation Order:**
1. Database schema changes (Brand model, relationships)
2. Model updates and migrations
3. API endpoints with proper validation
4. Frontend integration
5. Testing and optimization

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
```
Brands (1) ←→ (M) UserBrands (M) ←→ (1) Users
Brands (1) ←→ (M) Projects
Projects (1) ←→ (M) Tasks
Tasks (1) ←→ (M) Subtasks
Tasks (M) ←→ (M) Users (through UserTasks)
```

### API Structure
```
/api/brands/:brandId/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId
/api/brands/:brandId/users
/api/brands/:brandId/analytics
```

### Frontend Architecture
- Brand context provider
- Role-based component rendering
- Brand-aware routing
- State management with brand isolation

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Migration Risks
- Create comprehensive backup before migration
- Test migration on copy of production data
- Implement rollback procedures
- Gradual migration with feature flags

### Performance Risks
- Implement database indexing strategy
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor performance metrics

### Security Risks
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Multi-brand isolation working correctly
- [ ] Role-based access control functional
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed
- [ ] Security audit passed
