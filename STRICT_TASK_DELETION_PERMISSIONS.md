# 🔒 STRICT Task Deletion Permissions - Final Implementation

## 🎯 **Requirements (Strict Rules):**

### **Three-Tier Permission System:**

#### **Tier 1: Global Admin (Full Access)**
- **Global Role**: `admin` (mandatory)
- **Brand Role**: Not checked (any or none)
- **Result**: ✅ Can delete ANY task in ANY brand

#### **Tier 2: Brand Admin (Conditional Access)**
- **Global Role**: `brand_admin` (mandatory)
- **Brand Role**: `owner` OR `manager` (mandatory)
- **Result**: ✅ Can delete tasks ONLY in brands where they have owner/manager role

#### **Tier 3: Regular User (No Access)**
- **Global Role**: `user`
- **Brand Role**: ANY (even owner/manager)
- **Result**: ❌ CANNOT delete tasks (prevents accidental access)

## 📊 **Complete Permission Matrix:**

| Global Role | Brand Role | Can Delete? | Reason |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| `admin` | Any/None | ✅ **YES** | Global admin - full access |
| `admin` | `owner` | ✅ **YES** | Global admin - full access |
| `admin` | `manager` | ✅ **YES** | Global admin - full access |
| `admin` | `member` | ✅ **YES** | Global admin - full access |
| `brand_admin` | `owner` | ✅ **YES** | Both conditions met ✓ |
| `brand_admin` | `manager` | ✅ **YES** | Both conditions met ✓ |
| `brand_admin` | `member` | ❌ **NO** | Brand role insufficient |
| `brand_admin` | None | ❌ **NO** | No brand membership |
| `user` | `owner` | ❌ **NO** | Global role is only `user` |
| `user` | `manager` | ❌ **NO** | Global role is only `user` |
| `user` | `member` | ❌ **NO** | No permissions |
| `user` | None | ❌ **NO** | No permissions |

## 🔧 **Implementation:**

### **Controller Logic** (`controllers/brandTaskController.js`):

```javascript
// Delete task within a brand
const deleteBrandTask = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { brandId, id } = req.params;

    // PERMISSION CHECK: Explicit role-based authorization
    // Rule 1: Global admin - full access, no brand role check needed
    if (req.user.role === 'admin') {
      // Global admin can delete any task - proceed
    } 
    // Rule 2: Brand admin - must ALSO have owner or manager brand role
    else if (req.user.role === 'brand_admin') {
      if (!['owner', 'manager'].includes(req.userRole)) {
        return res.status(403).json({
          success: false,
          error: {
            code: 'INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION',
            message: 'Brand admins must have owner or manager role in this brand to delete tasks'
          }
        });
      }
      // Brand admin with proper brand role - proceed
    } 
    // Rule 3: Regular user (role: 'user') - NEVER allowed to delete
    else {
      return res.status(403).json({
        success: false,
        error: {
          code: 'INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION',
          message: 'Only admins and brand admins with proper brand roles can delete tasks'
        }
      });
    }

    // ... rest of deletion logic
  }
};
```

### **Route** (`routes/brandTasks.js`):

```javascript
// Delete task within a brand (permission check in controller)
router.delete('/:brandId/tasks/:id', auth, brandContext, brandTaskController.deleteBrandTask);
```

**Note**: No middleware authorization - all permission logic is in the controller for fine-grained control.

## 🔍 **Real-World Examples:**

### **Example 1: Global Admin (Full Access)**
```
User: System Administrator
Global Role: admin
Brand Role: None (not even in UserBrand)

Scenario: Tries to delete task in Brand A
Result: ✅ SUCCESS
Reason: Global admin has full access to all brands
```

### **Example 2: Brand Admin with Owner Role (Success)**
```
User: John Doe
Global Role: brand_admin
Brand Role: owner (in Brand A)

Scenario: Tries to delete task in Brand A
Result: ✅ SUCCESS
Reason: Has brand_admin globally AND owner role in Brand A
```

### **Example 3: Brand Admin with Manager Role (Success)**
```
User: Jane Smith
Global Role: brand_admin
Brand Role: manager (in Brand B)

Scenario: Tries to delete task in Brand B
Result: ✅ SUCCESS
Reason: Has brand_admin globally AND manager role in Brand B
```

### **Example 4: Brand Admin with Member Role (Blocked)**
```
User: Bob Johnson
Global Role: brand_admin
Brand Role: member (in Brand C)

Scenario: Tries to delete task in Brand C
Result: ❌ BLOCKED
Error: "Brand admins must have owner or manager role in this brand to delete tasks"
Reason: Has brand_admin but only member role (insufficient)
```

### **Example 5: Regular User with Owner Role (Blocked)**
```
User: Alice Williams
Global Role: user
Brand Role: owner (in Brand D)

Scenario: Tries to delete task in Brand D
Result: ❌ BLOCKED
Error: "Only admins and brand admins with proper brand roles can delete tasks"
Reason: Global role is only 'user' (accidentally given owner role)
```

### **Example 6: Regular User with Manager Role (Blocked)**
```
User: Charlie Brown
Global Role: user
Brand Role: manager (in Brand E)

Scenario: Tries to delete task in Brand E
Result: ❌ BLOCKED
Error: "Only admins and brand admins with proper brand roles can delete tasks"
Reason: Global role is only 'user' (prevents accidental deletion access)
```

## 🚨 **Security Benefits:**

### **1. Prevents Accidental Privilege Escalation:**
```
❌ BLOCKED: Regular user accidentally given manager brand role
✅ SAFE: Cannot delete tasks because global role is only 'user'
```

### **2. Enforces Dual-Factor Authorization:**
```
For brand_admin users:
  ✓ Check 1: Must have brand_admin global role
  ✓ Check 2: Must have owner/manager brand role
  Both required for deletion access
```

### **3. Clear Admin Hierarchy:**
```
Tier 1: admin (global) → Full access everywhere
Tier 2: brand_admin + owner/manager → Access in specific brands
Tier 3: user → No deletion access (even with brand roles)
```

## 📝 **Error Messages:**

### **Error 1: Brand Admin Without Proper Brand Role**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION",
    "message": "Brand admins must have owner or manager role in this brand to delete tasks"
  }
}
```

**When**: `brand_admin` user with `member` or no brand role tries to delete

### **Error 2: Regular User Attempting Deletion**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION",
    "message": "Only admins and brand admins with proper brand roles can delete tasks"
  }
}
```

**When**: User with global role `user` tries to delete (regardless of brand role)

### **Error 3: Task Not Found**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "TASK_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Task not found in this brand"
  }
}
```

**When**: Task doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the specified brand

## 🎯 **Frontend Integration:**

### **Check Delete Permission:**

```javascript
const canDeleteTask = (user, userBrand) => {
  // Rule 1: Global admin - always can delete
  if (user.role === 'admin') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Rule 2: Brand admin with owner/manager brand role
  if (user.role === 'brand_admin') {
    if (!userBrand) return false;
    return ['owner', 'manager'].includes(userBrand.role);
  }
  
  // Rule 3: Regular user - never can delete
  return false;
};

// Usage in component:
{canDeleteTask(user, userBrand) && (
  <button onClick={() => deleteTask(brandId, taskId)}>
    Delete Task
  </button>
)}
```

### **Delete Task with Error Handling:**

```javascript
const deleteTask = async (brandId, taskId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `/api/brands/${brandId}/tasks/${taskId}`,
      {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      }
    );
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      const error = await response.json();
      
      if (error.error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION') {
        if (error.error.message.includes('Brand admins must have')) {
          alert('You need owner or manager role in this brand to delete tasks');
        } else {
          alert('You do not have permission to delete tasks');
        }
      }
      
      throw new Error(error.error.message);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete task:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## 📊 **Test Results:**

### **Test Brand: "Brand1"**

| User | Global Role | Brand Role | Can Delete? | Test Result |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Shivank | `admin` | `owner` | ✅ YES | ✅ PASS |
| System Administrator | `admin` | None | ✅ YES | ✅ PASS |
| Sumit | `user` | `member` | ❌ NO | ✅ PASS |
| Govind | `user` | `member` | ❌ NO | ✅ PASS |

**All tests passed successfully! ✅**

## 🔒 **Security Summary:**

### **✅ What's Protected:**

1. **Prevents Accidents**: Regular users cannot delete even if given manager/owner brand role
2. **Dual Authorization**: Brand admins need both global role AND proper brand role
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Three-tier system with explicit rules
4. **Brand Isolation**: Users can only delete in brands where they have proper permissions
5. **Admin Override**: Global admins maintain full access for system management

### **❌ What's Blocked:**

1. Regular users with any brand role
2. Brand admins without owner/manager brand role
3. Users without proper global role
4. Unauthorized cross-brand access
